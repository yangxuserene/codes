0.5.2 (July 13, 2016)

Summer of CODES was another huge success! This release was created during the
  workshop.

general:
==========

the ROSS "commit" function was added to the CODES models from the latest
  version of ROSS (d3bdc07)

the pkg-config program is properly checked for, resulting in an error if it
  is not found.

the "configfile" API has been promoted to a public API, allowing more flexible
  management of configuration entities. It is currently undocumented.


networks:
==========

remove overly-restrictive assert from dragonfly

workloads:
==========

enabled max wait time stat in MPI replay

print an error message if pending waits never processed in MPI replay

utilities:
==========

the mapping context API gained a new mapping method, which uses the ratio of
  mapped-from to mapped-to entities to map contiguous mapped-from IDs.

0.5.1 (June 09, 2016)

network:
==========

corrected link latency calculation in dragonfly model

printf argument mismatch in dragonfly model

refactors to the torus bandwidth calculation to mirror that of the other
  networks (no functional change)

more robust type conversions in dragonfly (int sizes -> uint64_t)

removed the redundant and obsolete MPI replay simulator
  (modelnet-mpi-wrklds.c). The proper version to use is modelnet-mpi-replay.c

----------

0.5.0 (May 24, 2016)

general:
==========

codes-base and codes-net have been combined into a single project (now at
https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/codes/codes).

updated to ROSS revision d9cef53.

fixed a large number of warnings across the codebase.

networks:
==========

addition of the SlimFly network topology, corresponding to the Wolfe et al.
  paper "Modeling a Million-node Slim Fly Network using Parallel Discrete-event
  Simulation", at SIGSIM-PADS'16. See README.slimfly.txt
  (src/networks/model-net/doc).

modelnet now supports sampling at regular intervals. Dragonfly LPs can
  currently make use of this - others can be added based on demand. See
  (src/network-workloads/README_synthetic.txt).

dragonfly and torus network models credit-based flow control has been updated.
    Dragonfly model's adaptive routing algorithms have been updated. For details,
    see paper "Enabling Parallel Simulation of Large-Scale HPC Network Systems",
    M.Mubarak et al., at IEEE Trans. on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS).

allow 0-byte messages in model-net.

enable "local" model-net messages (for LPs sharing the same model-net endpoint -
  approximates a zero-copy ownership pass of the payload)

the model_net_event family of functions now return a token value which must
  be passed to model_net_event_rc2.

workloads:
==========

concurrent workload support added to workload generators and the MPI
  simulation layer. See codes-jobmap.h and the modified codes-workload.h.
  Thanks to Xu Yang for the partial contributions. Not all workload generators
  support concurrent workloads at this time.

scripts for generating job allocations specific to the torus and dragonfly
  topologies. See scripts/allocation_gen. Thanks to Xu Yang for the
  contributions.

multiple fixes to the MPI simulation layer and DUMPI workload generator.

concurrent workload support and more flexible rank mappings in the MPI
  simulation layer. Thanks to Xu Yang for the initial code.

removed scalatrace workload generator, which never made it to a usable state.

a new checkpoint IO workload generator has been added, based on the Daly paper
  "A higher order estimate of the optimum checkpoint interval for restart
  dumps" at Future Generation Computing Systems 2004. See README.codes-workload
  (src/workload).

utilities:
==========

fixes to rc-stack - memory no longer leaks in sequential mode, and optimistic
  debug mode is now supported.

added a more performance-sensitive function, codes_mapping_get_lp_info2, to
  codes-mapping (passes const pointers around instead of copying strings)

added a "mapping context" API for better controlling implicit LP-LP mappings,
  including modelnet, local storage model, and resource. See
  codes/codes-mapping-context.h and added functions in the mentioned LPs for
  details.

formalized a callback mechanism for CODES, replacing previous ad-hoc
  methods of passing control from LPs to arbitrary other LPs. The request and
  local storage model LP APIs have been changed to use this mechanism, and
  model-net has additional APIs to use user-provided mapping contexts. See
  codes/codes-callback.h for the API and tests/resource-test.c for advanced
  usage.

deprecations:
==========

model_net_event_rc (use model_net_event_rc2, which will eventually be renamed
  to model_net_event_rc)

codes_event_new (define your own bounds-checking macro if need be)

----------

0.4.1 (September 30, 2015)

general:
==========

fix compatibility with recent ROSS releases

----------

0.4.0 (May 6, 2015)

codes-base

general:
==========

significant source reorganization / refactoring

refactor some private headers out of the public eye

dead code removal

documentation:
==========

improved example_heterogeneous example program

added configuration to example_heterogeneous showing two torus networks

reorganized files to prevent name collisions on OSX. Top-level docs other than
  copyright now in doc directory

additions to best practice document

configurator:
==========

more stable file format for configurator output

ignore unrelated parameters passed into filter_configs

handle empty cfields in configurator

workloads:
==========

combined network and IO workload APIs into a single one

adding dumpi workload support in codes-workload-dump utility

workload dump utility option cleanup

renamed "bgp" workload generator to "iolang", significant cleanups

put network workload ops in workload dump util

removing one of the dumpi libraries from the build. It was generating some unwanted dumpi files.

network workload API more fleshed out

utilities:
==========

configuration bug fixes for larger LP type counts

resource LP annotation mapping hooks

local storage model API switch to use annotations

better configuration error handling

hedge against precision loss in codes_local_latency (see codes.h)

use a different RNG than default for codes_local_latency
- prevents addition/removal of codes_local_latency calls from poisoning RNG
  stream of calling model

added simple GVT-aware stack with garbage collection (see rc-stack.h)

codes-net

general:
==========

cleanup of much of the code base

more informative error for failure to find modelnet lps

removed redundant include directory on install (was 'install/codes/codes/*.h')

documentation:

  copyright now in doc directory

updated code documentation

fix linker error in certain cases with codes-base

tweaked config error handling


networks:
==========
fix to loggp latency calculation when using "receive queue"

made torus lps agnostic to groups and aware of annotations

miscellaneous fixes to dragonfly model

  receiver end. See src/models/networks/model-net/doc/README.simplep2p.txt

minor fixes to usage of quickhash in replay tool

fixed RNG reverse computation bug in loggp

fixed swapped arguments in round-robin scheduler causing short circuit

workloads:
==========

minor changes to dumpi trace config files

resolving minor bug with reverse computation in dumpi traces

includes more complete documentation.

codes-net

Initial "official" release. Against previous repository revisions, this release
includes more complete documentation and a rename of the "simplewan" model to
the "simplep2p" (simple point-to-point) model to more accurately represent
what it's modeling.
